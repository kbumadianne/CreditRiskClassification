# Credit Risk Report

## Credit Risk Analysis

The below data and analysis was taken into consideration for the Credit Risk Report:

* The purpose of this analysis was to build a model that can determine the creditworthiness of loan borrowers.
* The dataset is historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company, inclusive of 
    * loan size
    * interest rate
    * borrower income
    * debt to income
    * number of accounts
    *  derogatory marks
    * total debt
    * loan status.
* Using the above data points from historical lending, this analysis is trying to make correlations and predictions on if a loan would be healthy or high-risk.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any other algorithms).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
